# Peter Fintl — Executive Media Hub

A polished executive media hub hosted on **GitHub Pages**, showing selected media commentary, video highlights, publications, speaking engagements, and a dynamically-updated news feed — all driven by static JSON files and a daily GitHub Actions pipeline.

## How the news feed works

1. **GitHub Actions** runs `scripts/fetch-news.js` daily at 09:11 Vienna time.
2. The script queries **Google News RSS** (13 locales) for `"Peter Fintl"` and optionally **Brave Search** for topic queries.
3. Results are normalised, deduped, and merged into `data/archive.json` (rolling 1-year window).
4. On page load, `app.js` fetches `data/archive.json` and renders the **Latest Coverage** section with filter controls.

The pipeline is configured in `.github/workflows/fetch-news.yml` and requires no changes.

### Data sources

| Source | What it covers |
|---|---|
| Google News RSS — 13 locales | en-US, en-GB, en-AU, de-AT, de-DE, de-CH, zh-TW, zh-CN, ja, ko, fr-FR, it-IT, nl-NL |
| Brave Search News API | Optional topic queries (configured in `BRAVE_TOPIC_QUERIES`); requires `BRAVE_API_KEY` secret |

### Image pipeline

Each news card tries the following in order until an image is found:

| Priority | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `og:image` / `og:image:secure_url` / `twitter:image` scraped from article page | Skipped for Google News redirect URLs |
| 2 | RSS `<media:content>`, `<media:thumbnail>`, `<enclosure>` tags | Rarely populated by Google News |
| 3 | Outlet logo lookup | Domain or source-name matched against `data/as-seen-in.json` (supports `aliases` array) |
| 4 | `EXTRA_SOURCE_DOMAINS` map | Hardcoded in `fetch-news.js` for frequent outlets not in `as-seen-in.json` (e.g. Table.Briefings → `table.media`) |
| 5 | Domain extracted from source name | Handles plain domains (`schwarzwaelder-bote.de`) and second-level ccTLDs (`autoelectronics.co.kr`) |
| 6 | `google.com/s2/favicons?domain={host}&sz=256` | Final fallback; always resolves |

All outlet logos use `google.com/s2/favicons` (Clearbit was shut down). Cards whose `imageUrl` is a favicon URL get `object-fit: contain` with padding in CSS so small icons aren't stretched.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Push `main` branch to GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` → `/` (root)**.
3. The site is live at `https://fintlp.github.io/latest-news/`.

The GitHub Actions workflow commits data changes automatically with `[skip ci]`.

## Customising content

All curated content lives in JSON files in `/data/`. Edit them directly — no build step required.

| File | What to edit |
|---|---|
| `data/site.json` | Name, tagline, roles, hero intro, buttons, bio, contact info, footer |
| `data/featured-media.json` | Media & interview cards (replace `#replace-with-final-link` URLs) |
| `data/videos.json` | Video cards (YouTube thumbnails are auto-extracted) |
| `data/publications.json` | Articles and publications |
| `data/speaking.json` | Speaking engagements |
| `data/as-seen-in.json` | Outlet logos in the "as seen in" strip |
| `data/latest-news-config.json` | News section title, intro, time ranges |
| `data/manual-overrides.json` | Articles pinned permanently in the news feed |

### Adding articles to the news feed manually

Articles in `data/manual-overrides.json` are merged into the feed on every script run and are never pruned. Use this for articles that the automated pipeline misses (paywalled, not indexed by Google News, etc.).

Add an entry to the array:

```json
{
  "title": "Article title",
  "url": "https://www.outlet.com/article-path",
  "source": "Outlet Name",
  "sourceUrl": "https://www.outlet.com",
  "faviconUrl": "https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=outlet.com&sz=128",
  "imageUrl": null,
  "publishedAt": "2026-04-29T00:00:00.000Z",
  "snippet": "Short description of the article and what Peter Fintl said.",
  "manually_added": true
}
```

After editing `manual-overrides.json`, run the script locally to rebuild `archive.json` immediately, then commit both files:

```bash
node scripts/fetch-news.js
git add data/manual-overrides.json data/archive.json data/news.json
git commit -m "feat: add article to manual-overrides"
git push
```

**Important:** Only use plain ASCII double quotes inside JSON strings. Typographic quotes (`"` `"` `„`) will break the JSON parser silently — the script will fall back to an empty overrides list and none of the manual entries will appear.

### Adding outlet logos

Outlet logos are resolved automatically via Google's favicon service using the domain in `data/as-seen-in.json`. To add a new outlet, add an entry with its URL and optionally an `aliases` array for the source-name variants that Google News RSS uses:

```json
{
  "name": "Outlet Name",
  "aliases": ["shortname", "shortname.com"],
  "logo": "assets/logos/unused.png",
  "url": "https://www.outlet.com/"
}
```

For outlets that appear frequently but are not in `as-seen-in.json`, add them to `EXTRA_SOURCE_DOMAINS` in `scripts/fetch-news.js`:

```js
const EXTRA_SOURCE_DOMAINS = {
  'tablebriefings': 'table.media',
  'zonebourse':     'zonebourse.com',
  // add more here: normalizeSourceKey(sourceName) → domain
};
```

The `logo` field in `as-seen-in.json` is currently unused — logos are served from Google's favicon CDN, not local files.

### Adding an OG image

Place a 1200×630px image at `assets/og-image.jpg` for social sharing previews.

### Updating placeholder links

Media, publication, and speaking entries with `"url": "#replace-with-final-link"` render as non-clickable cards. Replace the URL with the real link when available.

## News feed configuration

Edit `data/latest-news-config.json`:

```json
{
  "sectionTitle": "Latest Coverage",
  "sectionIntro": "Recent media references...",
  "defaultRange": "90d",
  "availableRanges": ["7d", "30d", "90d", "1y", "all"],
  "fallbackUrl": "https://news.google.com/search?q=Peter%20Fintl",
  "externalSiteUrl": "https://fintlp.github.io/latest-news/"
}
```

Supported range values: `7d`, `30d`, `90d`, `1y`, `all`

---

## Local preview

```bash
npx serve .
# or use VS Code Live Server
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` — all sections should load including the news feed from `data/archive.json`.
